💸 Gamified FinTech Learning Platform with AI-Driven Market Insights
📌 Overview

This project is a gamified fintech learning platform designed to improve financial literacy among students and young professionals through interactive learning, simulated financial decision-making, and real-world market awareness.

Instead of traditional passive learning (videos and articles), the platform allows users to learn by doing — earning virtual credits, making financial decisions, and seeing how those decisions perform under changing market conditions influenced by real-world fintech news.

🎯 Problem Statement

Financial literacy among students and young professionals is alarmingly low.
Most existing platforms fail because they:

Are theory-heavy and non-interactive

Do not simulate real financial decision-making

Are disconnected from real-world market behavior

As a result, users struggle to understand risk, reward, market trends, and long-term financial planning.

💡 Solution

Our platform introduces a game-based learning approach where users:

Complete structured fintech learning modules

Earn virtual money/credits for completing modules

Use earned credits to make financial choices such as investing, saving, or spending

Compete on a leaderboard based on financial performance

The system dynamically adapts outcomes using AI-inferred market trends, making learning realistic and engaging.

🤖 AI & Market Intelligence

Gemini API is used to:

Summarize real-world fintech and market news

Infer current market sentiment (Bullish / Bearish / Neutral)

Market sentiment directly impacts:

Investment outcomes

Risk levels

Credit growth or loss

This removes reliance on static rules and makes the experience context-aware and realistic.
